> I am now able to use VSCode more smoothly and able to custom and write some extentions as needed. One thing that I am working on to improve is to use the keyboard to move around instead of using the mouse pad. This class and thing tips and trick to make sure that I have a better experience while using VSCode.

### Reflection
>I had used Linux and the command lines in the past while I am doing the internship last summer and I did not understand much about the concept and meaning of it, mostly I was following instructions. But I know I can move around with the command lines. Working with terminal is very fun and this experience had increased my curiosity. I think I had the advanced compared to those who did not take the class. I think all of the topics above contributed to my learning experience. Now I can open and work on a project with VSCode. Pull, push and commnit to Github to work and colaborate with more people working at once and doesn't mess up someone works. I feel like this class is like an "internship", I gained tons of experience about coding and basesic skills to able to work with others developers.
