# Where I started
#### Previous Experience
Coming into this class I felt like I had a decent understanding of the idea of version control and how the command line worked from having worked an internship this summer for a company called Panaton in Boise. I gained a relative understanding of how git worked, but it pales in comparison to how I feel about my understanding now. To quote a conversation we had during the term, you mentioned that a lot of people view git and its commands as a sort of magic tool that just does what they need but have no understanding of what or how it does it. Prior to taking this class I fell into that same category. I learned about the idea of version control and pull requests through bitbuckets UI and had a page in my notebook that I referred to to remember the process of pushing committing etc.

I knew what github was and have implemented things from other people into my own projects in the past, but had never actually joined the site. And I had used VS code as well as two other IDE's put out by JetBrains called pyCharm and Webstorm for my code.

When I started programming in highschool I started with java, and then here at C of I I took C++ classes. This summer I worked primarily in TypeScript and for this class I wrote my scripts in Python. I had never written a Bash script before taking this class.

Having had some experience with Typescript I had interacted with some HTML as well as JSON files prior to CS 490.

# What I learned
#### New Programs/Processes
##### GitHub/Git
This class was the first time that I've worked with GitHub and actually started learning what was going on behind the scenes with the Git Process. This was very interesting for me and I really enjoyed doing it. Having gotten a chance to learn about Git in this class has really increased my confidence in all aspects of version control. Which is good, because while working this summer, Git was something that my boss expected me to know and we used it almost every day.
##### Advent of Code
One of my favorite finds of this class was the discovery of the Advent of code series. I've found myself working on these projects throughout J term just as fun things to work on my programming skills and to become more familiar with VS code. I've also created a repository on my Github account that has all of my solutions in it. Allowing me to practice the idea of Version control while also working on these projects.
##### Command line
This was not my first time navigating through file systems via the command line, but I never expected that it would have become as comfortable as it has. I now feel more comfortable in navigating through my system via the command line as opposed to using file explorer. The installation of ZSH has been big for that, and I plan to use it as my default shell going forward for its auto-complete and auto-suggestions. This was also my first experience working with linux and Ubuntu which I think will really help me moving forward in my programming life.

##### Scripting
This class was the first time that I had written a bash script and my first time using the VIM editor. I find it very cool how powerful those small scripts can be, and plan to write more in the future. I am especially glad for the discovery of VIM, in computer architecture, I had tried to write a machine language program in the default VI before and had struggled tremendously to even get it to let me type or save my progress. I had a lot better experience using the vim editor.

##### Snippets
Another one of the cool things I liked learning about and building this semester were the snippets that we built. I wrote a couple python snippets that I now use all the time. The most useful of which has been the for loop snippet which has really sped up my ability to code.
##### What I found interesting / Want to look more into
The thing that I've started trying to be better about doing on a daily basis that there was a big emphasis for in this class is the keyboard shortcuts. My favorite is the ctrl + D which allows me to work on repeated instances of code so much more efficiently then if I were to have to change each one individually. I've been looking more into what others I can add and really trying to hold myself to only using the keyboard if neccesary and have found that it really does make me much faster.

Throughout the semester I have also made a note of things that were mentioned in class that I plan to look more into when I have free time. A short list of these things include:
- Setting up an AWS account
- Looking into using and implementing an API
- Looking into different virtual machines
- Setting up a password manager

# Outside of this class
Outside of class it was a good thing that I had been practicing my programming skills. I was recently tasked with sorting the responses for the major and minor declaration form for the PEAK center. What I thought would be quite easy was made much more difficult when I discovered that the excel I was given contained hundreds of columns and that users were allowed to enter in their own information. I was eventually able to get it how they wanted it with the help of a short script that I wrote in excel. 
# Summary
I'm really glad I took the class. I was originally in a different class that was not applicable to my major. No offense to learning about finite languages and automata as I understand how they are very important and can be very useful. But the things like git and VS code are the computer science subjects that I like learning about. Overall I enjoyed my time in this class a lot. I liked the topics we covered and enjoyed how the assignments forced you to actually use the things that we were learning about.
Thanks for a fun J term!
