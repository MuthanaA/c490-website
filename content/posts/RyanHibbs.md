# Where I started
#### Previous Experience
Coming into this class I felt like I had a decent understanding of the idea of version control and how the command line worked from having worked an internship this summer for a company called Panaton in Boise. I gained a relative understanding of how git worked, but it pales in comparison to how I feel about my understanding now. To quote a conversation we had during the term, you mentioned that a lot of people view git and its commands as a sort of magic tool that just does what they need but have no understanding of what or how it does it. Prior to taking this class I fell into that same category. I learned about the idea of version control and pull requests through bitbuckets UI and had a page in my notebook that I referred to to remember the process of pushing committing etc.

I knew what github was and have implemented things from other people into my own projects in the past, but had never actually joined the site. And I had used VS code as well as two other IDE's put out by JetBrains called pyCharm and Webstorm for my code.

When I started programming in highschool I started with java, and then here at C of I I took C++ classes. This summer I worked primarily in TypeScript and for this class I wrote my scripts in Python. I had never written a Bash script before taking this class.

Having had some experience with Typescript I had interacted with some HTML as well as JSON files prior to CS 490.

# What I learned
#### New Programs/Processes
##### GitHub/Git
This class was the first time that I've worked with GitHub and actually started learning what was going on behind the scenes with the Git Process. This was very interesting for me and I really enjoyed doing it. Having gotten a chance to learn about Git in this class has really increased my confidence in all aspects of version control. Which is good, because while working this summer, Git was something that my boss expected me to know and we used it almost every day.
##### Advent of Code
One of my favorite finds of this class was the discovery of the Advent of code series. I've found myself working on these projects throughout J term just as fun things to work on my programming skills and to become more familiar with VS code. I've also created a repository on my Github account that has all of my solutions in it. Allowing me to practice the idea of Version control while also working on these projects.
##### Command line
This was not my first time navigating through file systems via the command line, but I never expected that it would have become as comfortable as it has. I now feel more comfortable in navigating through my system via the command line as opposed to using file explorer. The installation of ZSH has been big for that, and I plan to use it as my default shell going forward for its auto-complete and auto-suggestions.
##### Scripting
This class was the first time that I had written a bash script and my first time using the VIM editor. I find it very cool how powerful those small scripts can be, and plan to write more in the future. I am especially glad for the discovery of VIM, in computer architecture, I had tried to write a machine language program in the default VI before and had struggled tremendously to even get it to let me type or save my progress. Now having used VIM I am much better and  
- WSL
- Shortcuts/Snippets
Confidence with understanding what is happening (note going into registry to change default download settings for jpg images)
###### What I found interesting
 - want to learn about HUGO and Markdown now, didnt love react js
 - note that your sure he had much more setup
#### What I enjoyed learning about

# Outside of this class
Make note of how I just wrote something to filter the responses to major minor form for PEAK mentor Job. 
# Summary
Really glad took the class. Was originally in different class not applicable to major. No offense to learning about finite languages and automata as I understand how they are very important and can be very useful Im glad I learned about them. But this is the type of thing I enjoy learning about. How to actually like make a project with a team and work towards building something cool.
GIT
Sparked my interest up again, I have found myself doing advent of code problems in free time and out of habit needed to just write down a list of names for a playoff fantasy football draft that I created in VIM
