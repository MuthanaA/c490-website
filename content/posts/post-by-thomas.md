# **CSC-490: Topics in Computer Science**

## **Intro**

The course CSC-490: Topics in Computer Science at The College of Idaho, which
was titled Practical Software Engineering, has been an extremely valuable and 
engaging course. Although many of the topics covered in this course were topics
that I had previously had experience in, I was able expand on my previous 
experiences. Throughout the course, I was consistently learning something new
and applying the newly-learned skill in realistic assignments. This is a class
that I wish I had been able to take earlier in my college career because it
covers many of the necessary skills that I had to learn on my own. I believe
that this specific Topics in Computer Science course will be incredibly helpful
to help prepare the underclassmen going into Computer Science and to help
reinforce important skills for the upperclassmen. 

## **Linux Command Line**

Towards the beginning of this course, we started with learning about the Linux 
command line from the following online tutorial: [Ryan's Tutorials - Linux Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/). 
About three years ago I was involved in a research project at The College of Idaho that required me to have an understanding of the Linux command line.
However, three years ago, I had no experience with the Linux command line at
all. I remember using this exact tutorial to learn the basics of the Linux 
command line for the research project that I was contributing to. Even though
I had already progressed through the tutorial once, I was able to brush up on
the commands that I had forgotten and learn some more complicated ones.  

For my research project, I only learned some of the more basic commands and was not as comfortable using commands such as `grep` or `awk`. In the past, I was also not as experienced using regular expressions, piping, flags or redirection. After taking this course, I have a greater understanding of how the Linux command line functions and how to combine commands to create valuable output. One interesting website that we made use of to understand regular expressions is the [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com). This website has a variety of different regular expression crosswords in the following 
format:

I found this site to be an engaging way to learn regular expressions. I
previously had an data analytics internship where I had to use regular
expressions and this website would have been a great way to learn.

## **Bash Scripting**

After learning about the Linux command line, we moved on to bash scripting. This
is one of the topics that I had almost no previous experience with. The only 
related experience I had was creating batch files on Windows. Similar to 
learning the Linux command line, we used another [Ryan's Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/).
After completing this tutorial and completing the assigned projects in class, 
I feel confident that I can create helpful bash scripts. In the future, I can
see myself using these skills both professionally and personally to automate
certain command line tasks.
