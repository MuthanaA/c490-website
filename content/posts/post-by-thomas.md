# **CSC-490: Topics in Computer Science**

The course CSC-490: Topics in Computer Science at The College of Idaho, which
was titled Practical Software Engineering, has been an extremely valuable and 
engaging course. Although many of the topics covered in this course were topics
that I had previously had experience in, I was able expand on my previous 
experiences. Throughout the course, I was consistently learning something new
and applying the newly-learned skill in realistic assignments. This is a class
that I wish I had been able to take earlier in my college career because it
covers many of the necessary skills that I had to learn on my own. I believe
that this specific Topics in Computer Science course will be incredibly helpful
to help prepare the underclassmen going into Computer Science and to help reinforce
important skills for the upperclassmen. 

## Linux Command Line

Towards the beginning of this course, we started with learning about the Linux 
command line 


## Bash Scripting


## Vim & Z Shell

## Git & GitHub
